This is an example usage for a propsed import resolution hook in the TypescriptToLua compiler

To Install
* Run `git submodule init` to clone the fork of TypeScriptToLua
* Run `npm run setup` to install the dependencies and link the modules
* Run `npm run build` to build all the modules
* Go to the /bundle/dist folder to get the output lua file

I wanted to use yarn workspaces, but they don't support package bins for linked dependencies, which made rebuilding tstl frustrating because I had to reinstall all the node modules every time.
